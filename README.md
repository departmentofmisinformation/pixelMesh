My take on an art cms


Everything is still pretty rough but it should pretty much work out of the box. Stick it on a server and drop your images into /res.

For now, you have to run make_blog.php to regenerate the html files if you change something.

No databases, no fuss. Edit settings in inc/config.php until the GUI works and the image titles in inc/db.txt
